# DiffusingColab (SDXL support)
a colab notebook repo for using Diffusers library for various tasks using pre-defined functions by me yourself! 


# Google wont ban this for free users as it is purely python based and we dont even import external scripts from anywhere, just like the god intended way of using colab

click on the .ipynb file and open in colab to open it in colab and the notebook should be easy to follow along-

has features like plotting your generated images or using loras! more on the way in the future hopefully-
