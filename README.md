# DiffusingColab (SDXL support)
a colab notebook repo for using Diffusers library for various tasks using pre-defined functions by me yourself! 


# Google wont ban this for free users as it is purely python based and we dont even import external scripts from anywhere, just like the god intended way of using colab

click on the .ipynb file and open in colab to open it in colab and the notebook should be easy to follow along-

has features like plotting your generated images,Lora comparision, using loras nd using seeds! more on the way in the future hopefully-

features in works: Custom 1.5 model downloads and conversion from civitai, hopefully seeing if it works for sdxl, etc


img2img and face restoration will be there seperate branch when this one is merged


use the Intesting branch if you want features like fixed seed, lora comparisions, etc! that branch will be merged with main once fixed seed and custom downloads are more bug tested and a new Img2imgtest branch will be created!

Big thanks to SilverandJade on Discord for helping and suggesting some wonderful features for this colab!!
