# DiffusingColab (SDXL support)
a colab notebook repo for using Diffusers library for various tasks using pre-defined functions by me yourself! 


# Google wont ban this for free users as it is purely python based and we dont even import external scripts from anywhere, just like the god intended way of using colab 
-ckperry


click on the .ipynb file and open in colab to open it in colab and the notebook should be easy to follow along-


has features like plotting your generated images, downloading loras from civitai, lora comparision, using manual seeds! more on the way in the future hopefully-


some features that may come in future: Custom Model download, inpainting, control-net


img2img and face restoration will be there in a seperate branch before being merged, so quite a while


Big thanks to SilverandJade on Discord for helping and suggesting some wonderful features for this colab!!
