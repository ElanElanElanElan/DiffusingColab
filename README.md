# DiffusingColab (SDXL support)
a colab notebook repo for using Diffusers library for various complex tasks using pre-defined functions by me yourself! (maybe gradio support in future)
google wont ban this for free users as it is purely python based and we dont even import external scripts from anywhere, just like the  god intended way of using colab

click on the .ipynb file and open in colab to open it in colab and the notebook should be easy to follow along(maybe)-
